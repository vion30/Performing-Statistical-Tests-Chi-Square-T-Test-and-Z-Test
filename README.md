# Performing Statistical Tests: Chi-Square, T-Test, and Z-Test


## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of various statistical tests, including Chi-square tests, T-tests, and Z-tests. Each statistical test is showcased with a unique dataset to explore assumptions, analyze relationships, and draw meaningful insights. The objective is to provide clear, reproducible steps to perform these tests for data analysis and decision-making.
## Key Features

- Chi-Square Tests: Analyze categorical data to determine if there are significant differences between expected and observed frequencies.

- T-Tests: Compare means between two groups to assess whether they are statistically different.

- Z-Tests: Calculate Z-statistics to test hypotheses for large datasets.

- Clear demonstration of importing datasets and performing statistical calculations.

- Reproducible Python code for real-world scenarios.
## Technology Used

- Python Libraries:

  Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

  NumPy: Numerical computations.

  Matplotlib/Seaborn (if applicable): Data visualization.

- Datasets:

  University dataset for Chi-square and T-tests.

  Boston Housing dataset for Z-tests.

## Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on approach to performing Chi-square, T-tests, and Z-tests using Python. By following the steps outlined, users can replicate the analyses and extend them to their datasets. Future enhancements may include:

- Adding more statistical tests.

- Automating test selection based on data type.

- Interactive dashboards for results visualization.
